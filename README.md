I am a student at IT-högskolan in Gothenburg to learn about AI and machine learning. Im currently 19 years old and recently moved to Gothenburg from Kungsör/Västmanland to study this course. It was first Back in High school in 2021 that i first got to learn basic software development for a project which involved to create a website. So that is were i really started to get interested.

Later after high school had finished i started to learn about Python through Youtube and guides on the internet on a basic level. That's when i decided to start at IT-högskolan to learn more and before the main course there was a pre-course where you needed to learn the knowledge of python and a very basic understanding of it. So that's really the background of how i got here and started to like IT.
